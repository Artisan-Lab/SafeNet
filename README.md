## Info
 
This project aims at mitigating the usage of Unsafe Rust Code though code review and refactor or replacement. We want to recommend useful safe code samples to developers based on their current Rust functions with unsafe code.

## Project Structure
### knowledgebase
A minimal code base with useful unsafe-safe (if exist) Rust code pairs.

### testdata
Unsafe code samples collected from GitHub

### src
Source code of code pre-processing and machine learning components.
